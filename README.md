# TetraMage

- TODO
  - Have an enemy to beat up
  - make the hitbox change depending on direction of facing
  - implement hitstun
  - implement pushback
  - implement wallbounce.

At least finish super basic combat system (move/attack in all four directions, light and heavy strings, hitsun pushback, wallbounce) before you give up on it that easily
